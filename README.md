Thank you for the hard work, Aerandir14

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it how you like.
The source did not specify the license, therefore I am not specifying it either.

I have reworked the script to suite my needs:
- specify initial fan PWM
- use functions
- changed logic for processor temp measurement.
